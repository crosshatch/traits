name: service-colocated-effect-layer-naming
subject: Effect layer exports and the placement of environment-specific service
  implementations.
requirement: Keep potentially environment-specific layer implementations in
  their owning service module, even when no alternative implementation exists
  yet; use layerFrom<InputSource>, such as layerFromFs. Export a module's
  unqualified primary layer for its core service as layer. Include a service or
  role in the export name only when the module provides layers for multiple
  services or roles and the shorter name would be ambiguous. Place
  implementation or backend qualifiers after the service or role, and append
  From<InputSource> when constructed from a particular input source. Use
  layer[FromInputSource] or
  layer<ServiceOrRole>[Implementation][FromInputSource]. Avoid XLive, XLayer,
  layerFooConfig, and layerFooEnv.
purpose: Keep layer ownership discoverable and names concise while making
  environment-specific construction explicit.
