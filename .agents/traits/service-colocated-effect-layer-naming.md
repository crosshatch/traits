name: service-colocated-effect-layer-naming
subject: Effect layer exports and the placement of environment-specific service
  implementations.
assertion: Keep potentially environment-specific layer implementations in their
  owning service module, even when no alternative implementation exists yet; use
  layerFrom<InputSource>, such as layerFromFs. As an exception, when the package
  separates host-specific code into a dedicated host directory that the core
  must not import (see host-specific-code-in-host-directories), put the layer in
  that directory, in its own host-specific module exporting it as layer,
  such as local/LocalSegmenterRegistry.ts referenced as
  LocalSegmenterRegistry.layer. Export a module's unqualified
  primary layer for its core service as layer. Include a service or role in the
  export name only when the module provides layers for multiple services or
  roles and the shorter name would be ambiguous. Place implementation or backend
  qualifiers after the service or role, and append From<InputSource> when
  constructed from a particular input source. Use layer[FromInputSource] or
  layer<ServiceOrRole>[Implementation][FromInputSource]. Avoid XLive, XLayer,
  layerFooConfig, and layerFooEnv.
purpose: Keep layer ownership discoverable and names concise while making
  environment-specific construction explicit.
