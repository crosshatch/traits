name: yield-services-inside-effect-helpers
subject: Reusable Effect helpers that depend on context services.
requirement: Acquire context services by yielding their service tags inside the
  Effect helper rather than threading service instances through ordinary
  arguments. When the helper backs an environment-free service method, bind its
  required context once during service construction.
purpose: Keep dependency requirements explicit in Effect’s environment while
  avoiding service-argument plumbing and preserving environment-free service
  interfaces.
