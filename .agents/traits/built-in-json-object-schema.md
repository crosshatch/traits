name: built-in-json-object-schema
subject: Effect Schema definitions for arbitrary JSON objects.
requirement: Use Schema.JsonObject for arbitrary JSON objects instead of
  defining an equivalent ad hoc record schema such as
  Schema.Record(Schema.String, Schema.Unknown). Keep explicit schemas when
  validating a specific object structure.
purpose: Reuse the built-in schema and restrict arbitrary object values to
  JSON-compatible data.
