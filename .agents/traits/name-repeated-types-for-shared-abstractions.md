name: name-repeated-types-for-shared-abstractions
subject: Repeated TypeScript type expressions representing the same abstraction.
requirement: Extract a descriptive named type and reuse it when multiple
  declarations repeat the same type expression for the same abstraction.
  Preserve generic parameters and their relationships. Do not unify types solely
  because their current structure matches when they represent independently
  evolving concepts.
purpose: Make shared contracts explicit and avoid duplicated type signatures
  drifting apart.

For example, define EffectTransformer once for a generic Effect-to-Effect transformation and use it for both asDecision and asFileRead, rather than repeating the full generic call signature.
