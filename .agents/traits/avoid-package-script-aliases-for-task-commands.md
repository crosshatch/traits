name: avoid-package-script-aliases-for-task-commands
subject: Package scripts for commands already exposed through a repository task CLI.
requirement: Invoke task CLI subcommands through the existing tasks script
  rather than adding redundant package-script aliases for individual
  subcommands.
purpose: Keep package scripts minimal and maintain one discoverable entry point
  for repository tasks.
