name: inline-small-single-use-helpers
subject: Small single-use helpers, including React atom logic, other than
  trivial error-constructor forwarding helpers.
requirement: Prefer inlining small single-use helper logic into the operation
  that consumes it instead of introducing a separately named helper. Extract a
  helper when reused, when naming materially improves readability, or when it
  defines a meaningful domain/API boundary. In React, inline into the relevant
  atom or Effect operation, not into component render or event handlers.
applicability: Applies to TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, and JSX.
purpose: Keep local behavior easy to follow without unnecessary helper indirection.
---
For example, place theme initialization directly inside its atom definition.

```diff
-const getName = (item) => item.name // Trivial single-use helper.
-const names = Array.map(items, getName)
+const names = Array.map(items, (item) => item.name)
```
