name: separate-heterogeneous-contracts-for-type-safety
subject: Services, registries, caches, and other abstractions combining variants
  with different input, result, error, or dependency types.
requirement: Prefer separate precisely typed instances or services when
  combining heterogeneous contracts requires conditional or indexed types whose
  variance or lost correlations lead to type assertions, widened
  error/dependency unions, or repeated kind-dependent branching. Reuse genuinely
  common lifecycle and execution machinery through typed helpers or constructors
  rather than forcing unlike contracts into one discriminator-driven interface.
  Retain a unified abstraction when it preserves those relationships cleanly
  without such workarounds.
applicability: TypeScript APIs and implementations, including Effect services and caches.
purpose: Preserve useful static guarantees and simple implementations without
  duplicating shared infrastructure.

For example, keep a registry whose setup produces an input-taking function separate from one whose setup produces a context-dependent Effect. Each can own a typed cache and its own validation/error contract while sharing a constructor for setup-fiber caching, scope ownership, inherited services, and isolated execution resources. Different type arguments alone do not require separate implementations or services; the signal is complexity introduced solely to recover relationships lost by unification.
