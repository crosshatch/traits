name: prefer-public-barrel-imports
subject: Imports of APIs re-exported by a package’s public barrel modules.
requirement: Prefer importing through the appropriate public package or
  subpackage barrel instead of a deeper module path when that barrel exports the
  needed API. Use namespace-qualified types when the barrel exports a module
  namespace rather than the type directly. Retain deeper imports when necessary
  for correctness or to avoid material runtime or bundling costs.
purpose: Keep imports concise and aligned with the package’s public API boundaries.
